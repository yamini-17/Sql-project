# Student Performance Analysis – ![SQL Project](https://github.com/yamini-17/Sql-project/blob/main/student%20database.sql)

A structured relational database project designed to analyze academic performance and attendance trends using SQL queries.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates a student academic database and extracts insights using advanced SQL queries including joins, aggregations, subqueries, and filtering techniques.

---

## Business Problem

Educational institutions need to:
- Identify top-performing students
- Track subject-wise performance
- Analyze attendance impact on scores
- Detect engagement patterns

This SQL project answers these analytical questions.

## Database Schema

Tables include:
- Students
- Subjects
- Marks
- Attendance

Relationships:
- Student ID used as primary key
- Foreign keys link marks and attendance to students

---

## SQL Concepts Used

- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
- Aggregate Functions (AVG, SUM, COUNT)
- Subqueries
- Filtering & Sorting
- Basic performance analysis queries

---

## Key Queries Performed

- Average score per subject
- Top 5 students by total marks
- Attendance vs performance correlation
- Students scoring above class average
- Subject-wise highest marks

---

## Insights Generated

- Identified subjects with lowest average performance.
- Determined attendance positively correlates with higher scores.
- Found top 10% performers contributing to overall academic excellence.

---

## Business Impact

Helps academic administrators:
- Monitor student performance trends
- Take early intervention actions
- Improve subject-level teaching strategies
